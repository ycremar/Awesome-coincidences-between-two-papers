# Awesome-coincidences-between-two-papers
The repository includes evidences that a published paper in TKDE shares surprisingly high similarity to our paper.

We are recently brought awareness that a survey paper ***Self-supervised Learning on Graphs: Contrastive, Generative,or Predictive*** by Lirong Wu et al., published in *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*, shares a very high similarity to our paper ***Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks: A unified review*** published in *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*. 

Although it is very possible that two survey papers on a same topic can share similar formulations and method descriptions, we are surprised that our **method taxonomy**, **paper organizations/storylines**, **figures**, **unified frameworks**, and many other **unique insights** to the topic also appear in their paper. Given the similarity in many individual dimensions of the two papers, we believe that the likelihood that the two papers are from a joint distribution is significantly higher than that they are independently from mariginal distributions. 

Below we summarize the timeline and provide a list of evidences about the similarity.

## Timeline

On Febuary 22, 2021, the first version of our review paper was made available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10757v1). **Three months later**, on May 16, 2021, the paper by Wu et al. became available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07342v1). After that, the paper by Wu et al. and our paper was published on December 1, 2021 and April 27, 2022, respectively.
